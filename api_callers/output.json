He is best known as the biological father of \u2018Apple\u2019 co-founder, Steve Jobs. It is interesting to note that Steve Jobs met his biological father a couple of times, when the latter was working as a manager at a restaurant in Sacramento, but Jobs did not know that Jandali was his biological father. When Jobs was told about his biological father, he did not express any wish to meet him. Though not as successful as his biological son, Jandali went on to establish a successful career in his own right. After working as an assistant professor at \u2018Michigan University\u2019 and \u2018Nevada University,\u2019 Jandali operated a restaurant before becoming the Vice Chairman of \u2018Boomtown Casino Hotel\u2019 in Nevada.\nRecommended For You\nAlso Known As: Abdulfattah John Jandali\nAge: 94 Years, 94 Year Old Males\nSpouse/Ex-: Roscille Colburn-Jandali (m. 2006), Joanne Schieble Simpson (m. 1955\u20131962)\nchildren: Mona Simpson, Steve Jobs\nBorn Country: Syrian Arab Republic\nFamily Members Business People\nRecommended For You\nAbdulfattah Jandali was born on March 15, 1931, in Homs, Syria. His father was a self-made millionaire and his mother was a homemaker. After graduating from high school, Jandali went to the \u2018American University of Beirut.\u2019 While studying at the university, he became an activist and even spent three days in prison. He left Beirut in the mid-1950s and moved to New York. He started living with one of his relatives named Najm Eddin al-Rifai who worked as the Syrian ambassador to the US. He attended \u2018Columbia University\u2019 and then joined \u2018Wisconsin University\u2019 from where he received a Ph.D. in Economics and Political Sciences.\nWhile studying at \u2018Wisconsin University,\u2019 he started dating a German-Swiss Catholic named Joanne Carol Schieble. However, Schieble\u2019s parents were not happy with the relationship and her father even threatened to stop sending her to the university if she continued her relationship with Jandali. Despite her parents\u2019 opposition, she continued her relationship and after spending the summer of 1954 with Jandali in Syria, she became pregnant with his child. Fearing her parents, Schieble traveled alone to San Francisco where she gave birth to a baby boy. She then gave him up for adoption and returned to her hometown. Her son, who was subsequently adopted by a couple in San Francisco, would grow up to become the co-founder of \u2018Apple Inc.\u2019\nAfter completing his education in the United States, Abdulfattah Jandali faced financial problems which forced him to return to Syria. He returned to his hometown hoping to find a job in the diplomatic corps. When he failed to land a job as a diplomat, he started working as the director of an oil refinery in Homs. He returned to the United States in 1962 and started working as an assistant professor at \u2018Michigan University.\u2019 He then started working as an assistant professor at \u2018Nevada University\u2019 before deciding to become a restaurateur. He then bought a restaurant and went on to become the Vice Chairman of \u2018Boomtown Casino Hotel\u2019 in Nevada.\nSix months after giving up her first-born child for adoption, Schieble lost her father. She then married Jandali in 1955. After their wedding, Schieble gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Mona. When Abdulfattah Jandali returned to Syria in search of a job, his relationship with Schieble strained. Schieble divorced Jandali in 1962 and married an ice skating teacher named George Simpson.\nAbdulfattah Jandali is a non-practicing Muslim. He initially wanted to study law at \u2018Damascus University\u2019 but decided to study at the \u2018American University of Beirut\u2019 because of his authoritarian father who didn't want his son to pursue law. Unlike his father, Jandali wanted to raise his son in a friendly environment. However, he could not spend time with his biological son. In one of his interviews, Jandali said that he did not intend to give up his son for adoption. While his son, Steve Jobs, became the co-founder of Apple, his daughter, Mona Simpson, went on to become an acclaimed novelist. In 2006,\ufffdAbdulfattah Jandali married Roscille Colburn-Jandali.\nHow To Cite\nPeople Also Viewed\nAlso Listed InSteve Jobs Never Knew His Biological Father But Had Eaten At His Restaurant Several Times Without Knowing It \u2014 His Dad, Unaware Jobs Was His Son said, 'He Was A Sweet Guy And A Big Tipper'\nApple Inc. Co-Founder Steve Jobs led a life marked by groundbreaking achievements in the tech industry. But his personal life, especially his family history, tells a story of emotional intricacies and unrealized connections. While it is well known that Jobs was adopted, a less-known fact is that he unknowingly met his biological father multiple times.\nBorn in 1955 to Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali and Joanne Schieble, Jobs faced a life-altering moment early on. His mother decided to give him up for adoption because of strong opposition from her father to her relationship with Jandali, a Syrian national. Jandali said, \u201cI was very much in love with Joanne. ... But sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria.\u201d\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?\n-\nAirbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO.

His biological parents reunited and had another child, novelist Mona Simpson, but eventually separated, with Joanne returning to the U.S. with Mona.\nJobs\u2019s journey to discover his biological family began after his adoptive mother died in 1986. He eventually met his biological mother and sister. Describing this bond, Jobs said in Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography, \u201cMona was not completely thrilled at first ... but as we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family.\u201d\nThe story took an unexpected turn when Jobs and his sister sought out their biological father. But Jobs decided not to meet Jandali, fearing the potential exploitation of their relationship. Jandali, unaware of his encounters with Jobs, told The New York Times, \"All of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... he was a sweet guy and a big tipper.\"\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nJobs frequently visited a restaurant managed by a Syrian, not realizing it was his biological father. \u201cI shook his hand, and he shook mine and that's all,\u201d Jobs said during a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. \"I learned a little bit about him, and I didn't like what I learned.\"\nDespite learning in 2006 that Jobs was his son, Jandali, driven by \"Syrian pride,\" refrained from initiating contact. He expressed his hope for a reconciliation as reported by the New York Post.\n\u201cI live in hope that before it is too late he will reach out to me. ... Steve will have to do that as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune.\u201d\nGenerating answer\nduration: 33.048021387\n", "response": "\nBorn in 1931 in Homs, Syria, Abdulfattah Jandali was the biological father of Steve Jobs.
